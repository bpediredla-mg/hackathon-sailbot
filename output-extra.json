        "content": "Templates Overview\nBring your message content, user information, user interests, data feed content, and third-party advertising together in a template.\nCreate and edit templates within the platform or by submitting all code and settings via the API.Example uses for triggered and campaign templates are listed below. For more information, see the Campaigns Overview and Triggered Messages Overview pages.\nBefore You Begin\nWhile you can create a template prior to adding one or more Lists of your users to the platform, it is helpful to consider:\n- Who is the audience for this template?\n- When will they receive the template? For example, it may be a campaign template sent after the user signs up for your newsletter or a transactional template sent to the user after completing a purchase.\n- How will content be pulled for this template? See the Date Feeds Overview page for more information on pulling dynamic content.\nNote: If this is your first time building templates, or you're building a new type of template for the first time, be sure to discuss your plans with your Customer Success manager. Your CSM can provide sample template code and ensure you are using best practices for template design and strategy.\nTo get started, see the templates overview, or first review some examples for each template type, below.\nTemplate Type Examples\nThese are just a few examples of what you can do with email templates. Given the large array of options available when sending Campaigns and Triggered Messages, and building templates for each, you can adapt each kind of message to your own needs.Triggered Messages\n- Personalized Welcome Emails\nLeverage your new users' signup data immediately, track the sources of your lead generations, and use Lifecycle Optimizer to create a dynamic welcome message \"flow\" that responds to customer behavior in their first few days! For more information, seeCapturing User Vars on Signup and Lifecycle Optimizer.\n- Purchase Confirmation Emails\nWhen each user purchases a product or service, automatically send a summary of the purchase for informational purposes, while optionally using the Personalization Engine to include customized offers and other user-specific content. You will need to specify this template in your Purchase API calls.\n- Abandoned Cart Emails\nReclaim your revenue by setting up automatic shopping cart reminders to remind users of items they left behind, using an Abandoned Cart template. Product information is automatically pulled into an Abandoned Cart template when you keep in sync with cart and purchase activity using the Purchase API. For more information, see Abandoned Shopping Carts.\nCampaign Email Messages\n- Dynamic Recurring Newsletters\nDeliver an individually curated experience to each of your customers based on real-time behavior and interests. Set up a newsletter-style template powered by a content feed, make it recurring, and send the right content to the right user, each and every time. In addition to your template, you'll also need to Create a Horizon Data Feed and Template and Set Up A Recurring Campaign\nUsing Templates\nOnce an email template has been created, visual or html, it can be used in the rest of the system.\nLifecycle Optimizer\nYou will need to select templates in Lifecycle Optimizer for any of its email-related actions. Lifecycle Optimizer is ideal for user-specific triggered or transactional emails like a welcome series, purchase confirmation, winback message, or password reset. To start a flow from an email send, open, or click you will need to select the relevant starting action. You will be presented with a list of the templates in your account representing your emails. Choose the appropriate email's template. To send an email as an action, you will again be presented with the list of templates in your account including both visual and html emails.\nCampaigns\nIndividual mass mailings can be built from scratch or they can be partially created using a template to configure the email. Campaigns will accept both visual and html templates, however, Campaigns don't support the Email Composer tool so subsequent changes will be HTML only. To use a template in campaigns, create a new campaign. Name it and select the type of campaign. Templates are supported in all campaign types: Regular, A/B Tests, and Recurring. After your campaign is created, navigate to the Configure tab. The first option is to \"Build Your Campaign From a Template\". Select this and choose the template from the dropdown. Choose \"Dynamic\" if you want the email rendered uniquely for every user or \"Static\" if any dynamic elements should be rendered before the send. If you do not know, dynamic is generally what you will want. Choosing a template will overwrite the existing campaign fields with the template's settings. This includes the subject line, from name & email, as well as the HTML of the email. This however does not happen in the other direction. Changes made in the campaign builder will only apply to that campaign and will not affect the template.\nAPI\nTriggered/transactional email can also be sent using the Send API when specifying one or more recipients and the name of a template. See the documentation for more details on the Send API.\nEmojis\nEmojis used in your templates should display properly for all email providers and platforms. There are two instances in which they might not display:\n- The emoji is a custom emoji. This will only show on devices with the emoji installed.\n- The subscriber has an older machine, for example, one that hasn't had a browser or OS update since 2016."

        "content": "Track Link Clicks with Google Analytics\nTrack link clicks in your emails and attribute those clicks back to the unique customer. This data is useful in aggregate to determine the response to your emails, including attributing purchases to sends, and also at the individual level to determine a user's engagement and interaction with Lifecycle Optimizer rules and Audience Builder filters.\nAll links will automatically be rewritten when they are included in your emails, wrapped in a unique tracking URL that uses the Link Domain you have set on your Settings Page. To activate link tracking for a given template or campaign, within its settings, simply ensure that the Link Tracking option is set to Yes. We recommend turning on link tracking; if link tracking is disabled, the attribution described above will not function.\nAs an example of how link tracking works, if your site's domain is example.com, your link domain might be set to link.example.com. When you include a link in your email to example.com/item/123, your email recipients will instead receive a link URL beginning with link.example.com and ending in a tracking code. When the user clicks, that click is logged and quickly redirects the user to the applicable page on your site, example.com/item/123.\nIf your account has multiple link domains, the link domain used to rewrite links is the one you set on your template Settings page.\nGoogle Analytics Integration\nIf you set Use Google Analytics? to \"Yes\", then all links will add special utm\nparameters that will allow you to identify traffic coming from emails in Google Analytics. It is highly recommended to enable if you are using Google Analytics on your site.\n- A total of five parameters are automatically appended when you enable Google Analytics:\n- utm_campaign: will automatically be the name of the campaign as it appears in Engage by Sailthru.\n- utm_medium: will automatically be \"email\".\n- utm_source: will automatically be \"Sailthru\".\n- utm_term: will automatically be the name of the sending list as it appears in Engage by Sailthru.\n- utm_content: if you are sending an AB Split or AB Winner or Auto Winner Campaign, this utm parameter will be added to your links. For segment A, the value will be \"A\", for B, \"B\" and \"Final\" for the Final version of the AB Winner/Auto Winner test.\n- If you'd like to override the default value of email for utm_medium or add new utm parameters to your links, then go to the Advanced tab of your template/campaign. In the \"Auto-Append Link Parameters\" field write the new or current parameter with its respective value, such as\nutm_medium=MorningEmail\n- You can turn on this setting independent of the Link Tracking setting.\nNote:\n- Not all website UTM parameters work properly with Google Analytics. Please see Google's help page on Custom Campaigns for more information.\n- Links to Hosted Pages are not tracked and are not included in reporting."

Add alternate text here:\nBest Practices for Vision and Print\nSome of the General Accessibility best practices crossover with best practices for vision and print accessibility. Use a readable web font Choosing easily legible fonts will benefit your readers from the outset and open your messaging to the widest audience. The most recommended fonts are simple and unadorned, and are likely to be available on a reader's device. Verdana, Arial, Tahoma, and Helvetica are recommended sans serif fonts. This is also applicable to building an Overlay. Use Headings to organize your content Readers using screen readers may use heading tags to jump between content sections. If your message comprises a few parts, consider using HTML headings to tag content sections. This is automatically handled in Email Composer.\n<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">\n<code>\n<!DOCTYPE html>\n<html>\n<html lang=\"en\">\n<head>\n</head>\n<body>\n<h1>This is the first section of content</h1>\n<p>Introductory content</p>\n<h2>This is a new section</h2>\n<p>Content for the new section</p>\n</body>\n</html>\nUse sufficient color contrast Use more than one color in your messaging--a good color contrast will make your content easier to read. Be careful with red and green color combinations, as well. This is also applicable to building an Overlay.\nBest Practices for Mobility and Touch\nThere are a few considerations for readers with mobility issues. These suggestions are applicable to both building an email template and an Overlay.Use bulletproof buttonsButtons that are at least 42px will give users the best experience and provide a large enough clickable surface. Give links multiple sensory characteristicsMake sure links are easier to see by giving them a different color, underlining them, or changing their size.\nMore Resources\nCheck out these links for outside resources on building accessible messaging.

        "content": "Image Library\nManage your images independently of the Email Composer image tile with the Standalone Image Library.\nHow the Image Library works\nUpload and organize your own images or search for free images you can use in your messaging.\nIn the early access release, the new Image Library will not be available within any of the template builders. You'll need to use the URL or the new Zephyr function to insert an image into your template.\nCreate a new folder and upload an image\nDecide on a folder structure before you begin uploading images. You can nest folders to create a more complex structure. Images must be uploaded to a specific folder.\nCreate custom folders to organize your images in the Image Library:\n-\nNavigate to your image library from the Messaging menu (Messaging > Image Library)\n-\nSelect the Add Folder button next to the search box.\n-\nA new folder will show in the gallery. Give the folder a name and select the blue check.\n-\nTo create sub-folders, select a folder to open it and complete steps 3 and 4 again. Folders initially appear in the order in which they're created. The newest folder appears first. Select any of the header options (Name, Date, Size, or Type) to reorganize folders.\n-\nTo upload an image, select a folder and then select the Upload button.\n-\nSelect the image or images to upload from your system's file manager. As your file uploads, you'll see a progress bar before the folder reloads and shows the image.\nNote: You may upload up to 4 images at a time. -\nView your folders. Each folder shows how many images it contains.\nA folder can't be deleted until it's empty. You can mass delete items in a folder. Select the check mark in the top left corner of the image preview for each item you wish to delete, then select Delete All.\nImage Library Limits\nThere are some limits on the Image Library:\n-\n999 Max items per folder\n-\n5 Max number of nested directories.\n-\n4 Max concurrent uploads per user.\n-\n10MB Max image size.\n-\nAll image file types are allowed.\n-\n.webp files can be uploaded, but a thumbnail will not be available in the Image Library. The file will be available for use in a template.\nUse an image in a template\nSince the Standalone Image Library isn't accessible in the template builders, you can insert the image using a Zephyr function. After you upload an image, the image card shows in the folder with a Zephyr button. The button creates the Zephyr statement for you.\nSelect the button to copy the statement to your clipboard. For the example image, the Zephyr would resemble the following:\n{media(\"/April/promo.jpg\")}\nNotes:\n-\nThe forward slash must be included even if the image is in the root directory.\n-\nThe Zephyr function is case sensitive. If the image file name is \"gold.jpg\", then it must be added that way. Using \"Gold.jpg\" will not work.\nUse an image in an HTML template\n-\nSelect the Zephyr button on the image you wish to use in the image library.\n-\nOpen an existing template or create a new one.\n-\nIn the Code tab, use the following to insert an image:\n<img src={media(\"/April/promo.jpg\")}> -\nSave your work.\nUse an image in a Visual template\n-\nSelect the Zephyr button on the image you wish to use in the image library.\n-\nOpen an existing template or create a new one.\n-\nAdd an HTML block to your template and select it to open the properties panel.\n-\nAdd the following to insert an image:\n<img src={media(\"/April/promo.jpg\")}> -\nSave your work.\nDelete an image\nTo remove an image from your Image Library, select the trash can icon on the image and confirm the deletion. It will be removed from your library, but will still be shown in any templates that were sent including the image. That way your subscribers will not see a broken image.\nUploading a duplicate image after deletion\nIf you delete an image and then upload another image with the same name, you'll be prompted to either replace the deleted image or keep both.\n-\nIf you choose to replace the image, the latest one will be kept.\n-\nIf you choose to keep both, then the current image will be renamed. For example, instead of promo.jpg, it will be named promo_1.jpg.\nDelete a folder\nTo delete a folder, you must first delete all the items in a folder. If you wish to delete a set of nested folders, you must delete all the items out of each folder, delete each nested folder, and then delete the main folder."

Your CSM can ensure you are using best practices for template design and email strategy.\nHTML 3.0\nEmail Composer now uses tables to create the HTML for your email template. This should not cause an issue with rendering existing templates, unless they contain a lot of custom code.\nWe recommend creating a copy of any existing template that needs to be edited. This will preserve an original version of the template in the unlikely event that it does not render properly in tables.\nHow it Works: An Overview\nWithin the interface, email templates created with Email Composer are labeled as Visual Templates. They can be selected and used by our system in the Campaign workflow, Lifecycle Optimizer, and the API. Email Composer provides drag-and-drop formatted rows and content blocks for you to build your template from scratch. You can also use a formatted template available in the Idea Gallery. To build a new template: create a new Visual Template, configure the template settings, and then add rows and content blocks.\nAuto-saving\nChanges to your templates will auto-save 5 seconds after all users stop editing. To incorporate final changes into your template, select the Save button.\nWhen auto-save is working you'll see a notification next to the Save drop-down menu. This will show either a \"Saving changes\" message or a \"Changes saved\" message. This will also tell you if the template has been saved and when it was last saved.\nAny unsaved changes (changes that have not been finalized by selecting Save) will not be sent.\nEven with changes being auto-saved, you may still see a notice about unsaved changes when you are the next person to open a template. These are changes that have not been finalized by selecting Save or reversed by using the Remove Unsaved Changes option.\nRemove unsaved changes through the Preview Last Saved option.\nSelect Preview Last Saved from the Save drop-down menu.\nSelect Remove Draft Changes on the Preview page.\nFrom the Remove Draft Changes modal window, select Remove Changes.\nCreate a New Template\n- Select Templates from the Messaging menu.\n- Hover over the New Template bar to open the template menu.

When you select Save, a \"Last Saved\" timestamp appears next to the button and will update when the template is saved.\nIn the following image, the timestamp says \"Saved yesterday at 10:48 AM PM\".\nThe Save drop-down menu contains several other options for your template.\n- Preview - preview the template (includes unsaved changes)\n- Preview Last Saved - preview the last saved version of the template\n- Test Send - send a test to see how your template shows in your inbox\n- Save As - save a copy of your template with a new name\nWhen using your template in a Campaign, all the changes you wish to include must be saved. Unsaved changes will not be sent. You will be prompted to review any changes.\nPreview a template and the email client test\nThe preview option is available from the Save button menu. To preview a template:\nHover over the Save button and select Preview Last Saved from the drop-down menu.

        "content": "Template Structures and Blocks\nEmail creation and editing is divided into two main areas. The Canvas, where you drag and drop content and structural elements, and the Configuration panel where the drag-and-drop options and their properties live.\nThe Configuration panel has three tabs to help control the appearance of your email: Content, Rows, and Settings.\nSettings\nOn the Settings tab, you can set global properties for your email.\n- Content area width - Set the width, in pixels, for your email's body. This is a fixed width and only applies to desktop. When viewed on a mobile device, your structure is converted to a single column that matches the width of the user's device.\n- Background color - Set a default color to apply to the background of your email. Choose transparent to not set a color.\n- Content area background color - Set a color to apply to the content width area of your email. When used in conjunction with the background color it can create a distinct area to highlight your message.\n- Default Font - Global font used for all text, except any text blocks where you have specified a different font.\n- Link Color - Set all links, including newly created links, to a specified color.\nRows\nNext, you'll set up the layout of your email using rows. Rows serve as containers for the content in your email, including text and images. The following are available on the Rows tab:\n| Single Column | |\n| Centered Double Column | |\n| Left-Offset Double Column | |\n| Right-Offset Double Column | |\n| Triple Column | |\n| Quadruple Column |\nEvery new template starts with a single-column structure in place, ready to receive a content block. (This is covered in the next section, Content. For example, you might drag in an image to create a hero image.) The rows can also be stacked on top of each other. For example, a three column structure could be placed beneath the hero image's single column, to display three featured products or articles. The use of the editor's column structures helps ensure mobile responsiveness without any extra configuration or code. By default, adjacent columns will stack on top of each other when the email is viewed on a small screen. Columns that run left to right will display top to bottom. There is, however, an option to disable stacking for any email.\nVertical Alignment\nSet the vertical alignment for each column in a row with multiple columns. This row property allows all rows to be aligned at the top, middle, or bottom of a taller row.\nCustom Columns\nCreate custom-sized columns for your templates. Three of the pre-built column structures allow for customizing the columns. From the Rows tab, under Empty Rows, look for the column structures that contain dashed boxes. They're outlined in orange in the following image:\nDrag your selected row onto your template. Select the row to open the Row Properties in the Rows tab. From the Customize Columns section, you can set the column size and add new columns to customize your layout.\ndots between each column to resize the column width. Select a column to show the column settings options. If you need to delete a column, select the column and click delete.\nDisplay Rules and Conditions\nApply display conditions at the row level. One rule is supported per row. Additional logic can be added by editing the rule orby following the steps under Zephyr Display Rules and Conditions.\nNote: This feature defaults to string data types. To use a Boolean value or a number, edit the condition as in step 5 and remove the quotation marks around the value.\n- Select a row in your template to open Row Properties in the Row tab.\n- Click the Add/Edit Display Rule button.\n- Add your initial rule in the Add/Edit Display Rule modal. Click Add to save your rule.\n- Your rule is added to the row.\n- To edit the condition, click the Edit condition button. When the Edit modal opens, you can edit any of the content, including the\n{if}\nstatement. - Click Confirm to finalize your rule and apply it to the selected row.\nZephyr Display Rules and Conditions\nIf you need to add more complex display conditions, use Zephyr. You can either add conditional logic at the template level and run a check on a row or add conditional logic at the row level.\nAdd a Template-Level Variant and a key/value Check\nSelecting Add/Edit Display from the Row editor prompts a conditional row, allowing for a key/value pair check. Note: The value assumes a string. Entering a numeric or boolean value is not advised.\nTo use non-string fields and/or more customized logic, create template-level variables in Setup using Zephyr conditionals. Find the Setup section under the Advanced tab in Email Settings. Select the gear icon next to the Save button to open Email Settings.\nZephyr conditionals can be as simple or complex as you'd like, allowing you to check for the existence of a boolean, if a numeric value is between a certain range, and more:{*Check if a boolean value is true*}\n{if my_boolean_var}\n{show_prompt_1 = \"yes\"}\n{/if}\n{*Check if a numeric field equals 1*}\n{if my_numeric_var == 1}\n{show_prompt_2 = \"yes\"}\n{/if}\n{*Check if numeric field does not equal 2*}\n{if my_numeric_var != 2}\n{show_prompt_3 = \"yes\"}\n{/if}\n{*Check if numeric field is between 10 and 20 OR a boolean field is not false*}\n{if (my_numeric_var >= 10 && my_numeric_var =< 20) || my_boolean_var != false}\n{show_prompt_4 = \"yes\"}\n{/if}\n{*Check if a variable false/null/doesn't exist*}\n{if !my_other_var}\n{show_prompt_5 = \"yes\"}\n{/if}\nThen check if your new field is equal to the value you set. Select the Add/Edit Display Rule button to add your check:\nThe Custom Field contains your key and the Field Value contains your value.\nAdd Logic in the Editor- To add conditional logic directly in the editor instead of creating custom fields in Setup, select your row and then the Add Condition button to open the editor.\n- Add a name and description for your condition.\n- Add the opening conditional logic in the Before field. This usually starts with {if...}\n- Add the closing to the After field. The editor should resemble the following image:\n- Select Confirm to add your condition.\nLocked Rows and Content\nIf you have the appropriate user permissions enabled, you can lock and unlock rows and row content. Locking the row prevents others from editing your row settings or moving the row. Locking content prevents others from editing your content.\nLock a Row\n- In a new or existing template, select the row you wish to lock. The lock option in the Row Properties panel is unlocked by default.\n- Select the toggle next to Unlock to lock the row. The entire row turns blue to indicate that it's locked.\nLock Content\n- In a new or existing template, select the content you wish to lock. The lock option in the Content Properties panel is unlocked by default.\n- Select the toggle next to Unlock to lock the row. The entire row turns blue to indicate that it's locked.\nSaved Rows\nSaved rows help you streamline your template creation process. Create a universal header or footer once and use it across all your email messaging. Either process - saving or using a saved row - requires only a few steps to complete.\nNotes:\n- It is not currently possible to rename Saved Rows.\n- Your Saved Rows appear in the order you created them, starting with the most recent.\n- If you can't find your row, use quotation marks around the name when searching. This returns an exact value.\n- There is a maximum of 30 saved rows that can be displayed.\nCreate a Saved Row\n- Select the row you would like to save.\n- Select the save icon from either the row itself or the row properties menu.\n- Give your row a name and select Create Saved Row. Your saved row will be available.\nUse a Saved Row\nWhen you're using a Saved Row, you can edit the row within a template. The edits you make will only affect the template, not the Saved Row itself.\n- Select the dropdown menu under Rows.\n- Select Saved Rows from the menu.\n- Search for or scroll to the saved row you would like to use.\n- Drag the saved row to your template as you would with any other row.\nDelete a Saved Row\n- After searching for the row you'd like to delete, click on the delete icon on the lower right-hand corner of the row.\n- Click the \"Delete\" button.\n- To confirm you'd like to delete the row, select the \"Delete row\" button in the modal.\nContent Blocks\nWhen the layout of your email is in place, add visual components by dragging them from the Content tab into a row. Multiple Content blocks can be added into one row.\n- Content blocks already in place can be reordered or moved to a different structure by selecting them, then clicking and holding the access arrows while dragging to the desired location.\n- Once you add your first content block, you'll see an Undo option appear in the lower left corner of your canvas. The buttons include Undo, Redo, and a History icon. Selecting the History icon shows a timeline of your last 15 edits within the current browsing session.\n- Every block's padding, or separation, can be set in its Properties panel under Block Options.\nText\nTo add text to an email, select the content tab and drag the Text content block into a structure. You will see the following text appear. \"I'm a new Text block ready for your content.\" Click anywhere on that sentence to edit the text (you can triple-click the text to highlight and replace it). A number of text formatting tools is displayed:\n- font family\n- font size\n- bold, italics, underline, and strikethrough\n- text alignment\n- numbered and non-numbered bullets\n- text and background color\n- link text\n- special links are also available here for:\n- User-specific unsubscribe\n- View online\n- Anonymized link for sharing\nCollapse the floating editor using the Collapse button . Note that if you set the font family to Global Font, it will inherit the font family selected under the SETTINGS tab. This allows you to change the font family for multiple elements at once just by changing that property in the Settings tab.\nCustom Fonts\nTo add a custom font, see the Custom Font Management documentation.\nCustom Font Resources\n- Learn more about web-safe fonts with Mozilla's documentation.\n- For more information on font-family stacks: https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/pr_font_font-family.asp\n- If you use Typekit fonts: https://helpx.adobe.com/typekit/using/html-email.html#support\nParagraph\nTo add a paragraph of text to an email, select the content tab and drag the Paragraph block into a structure. You will see the following text appear. \"I'm a new paragraph block.\" Click anywhere on that sentence to edit the text (you can triple-click the text to highlight and replace it). A number of text formatting tools is displayed in the floating toolbar and in the Content Properties panel:- font family\n- font weight\n- font size\n- text color\n- bold, italics, underline, and strikethrough\n- text alignment\n- text and background color\n- link text\n- special links are also available here for:\n- User-specific unsubscribe\n- View online\n- Anonymized link for sharing\nList\nAdd custom lists to your messaging. The List block supports either unordered (bulleted) lists or ordered (numbered) lists. From the Content tab, drag a List block into a row. By default, it will be a bulleted list. Use the Content Properties to customize the list. Select the type of list and the list style you prefer. Options beyond type and style are similar to the Paragraph and Text block options.Image\nThe Image block comes with an image uploader to receive your images. You can either drag an image file on top of this block or click \"Browse\" to reuse images from your account or other services. You will have several methods for uploading images, including a file upload, upload from a URL, import from services like Instagram, as well as a free image search. By default, images will automatically be sized to fit the structure within which they are contained. This is the recommended setting to ensure images resize correctly for any screen. However, you can disable automatic sizing and set the image to be a percentage of the structure's column. Use the Properties panel to set the alternative text as well as any destination URL. If you intend on populating the image with a dynamic image like a countdown timer or an advertisement, you can select \"dynamic image\". This will allow you to set a dynamic image for the send while still viewing a sample image in the composer. Notes:- When uploading an image with the same name as an existing image in Visual Composer, the image will take approximately 1 hour to propagate to any templates using the image. Make sure to wait for the image to propagate before sending. This restriction only applies to replacing images. New images will immediately propagate.\n- The maximum allowed file size is 20MB.\n- Animated GIFs wider than 1920px will be resized on upload and become static images. We recommend using GIFs under 1920px in width.\n- All image file types are allowed.\n- Total image storage is not currently capped for the lifetime of your Saithru account.\nCreate Image Folders\nCreate custom image folders to organize your uploaded images. Before uploading images:- Decide on a folder structure for your image gallery. You can nest folders to create a more complex structure.\n- Create the folders. Images must be uploaded to a specific folder and cannot be dragged and dropped into a folder after upload.\n- Select the Image block and drag it into your template.\n- Select Browse to open your image gallery.\n- Select the Add Folder button next to the search box.\n- A new folder will show in the gallery. Give the folder a name and select the blue check.\n- To create sub-folders, select a folder to open it and complete steps 3 and 4 again. Folders initially appear in the order in which they're created. The newest folder appears first. Select any of the header options (Name, Date, Size, or Type) to reorganize folders.\n- To upload an image, select a folder and then select Upload from the File Manager.\n- Select the image or images to upload from your system's file manager. As your file uploads, you'll see a progress bar before the folder reloads and shows the image.\n- View your folders. Each folder shows how many images it contains.\nButton\nInsert a call-to-action button that can open a web page in the user's browser. Alternatively, buttons can be set to send an email, make a call, or send an SMS from the user's device to your chosen recipient. Selecting the text of the button in the canvas will provide a limited text editor. The action and destination URL are set in the Properties panel, where you can also set the button's background color and text color, border, width, and roundness.\nDivider\nA customizable horizontal rule.\nSpacer\nA customizable, invisible spacer block. Use this to create space between design elements.\nSocial\nA configurable set of social network buttons. Choose a design in the Properties area, then configure which networks to include and your ID/address for each.\nYou can also include custom social buttons by clicking Add new icon.\nHTML\nUsing your own code may affect how the message is rendered. Make sure to use correct and responsive HTML. Where possible, is recommended to build with the editor's options instead, to ensure code is valid and the design is responsive. To add an HTML block to your template in Email Composer:\n- Decide on your template formatting. If you're using the available row structures, drag them into place on your template.\n- Drag an HTML block from the Content Pane to your desired location in your template.\n- Click the HTML block. The Content Properties pane opens for your HTML block.\n- Add your HTML content.\n- Finish editing your template.\nNotes:\n- Using includes is supported in HTML blocks, but is not a best practice. Using includes can require additional custom code to ensure it smoothly relates to a visual template.\nFormat your include to resemble the following:\n{include 'include name'}\n. Remember to check your content width settings. - Make note of the following when using Zephyr in Text blocks and/or HTML blocks:\n- The syntax Zephyr uses for conditional logic is not fully supported in Text blocks. To ensure your content will render correctly, move any Zephyr that uses any of these characters:\n&\n,>\n,<\n,&\n,>\n,<\ninto the setup tab. Once there, reference the Zephyr logic from inside the Text blocks using variables. - When using HTML blocks with Zephyr, we recommend disabling HTML Sanitizer. Please contact support to proceed.\n- The syntax Zephyr uses for conditional logic is not fully supported in Text blocks. To ensure your content will render correctly, move any Zephyr that uses any of these characters:\n- Depending on your use case, you may use Display Conditions on rows that contain HTML and/or Text blocks in place of Zephyr.\nVideo\nAdd a YouTube or Vimeo URL to automatically generate a preview image. The image will link to the provided URL in a new tab.\nIcons\nCreate flexible, branded designs with custom icons. To add a custom icon:\n- Select the Icon content block from the Content tab and drag it into position. You'll see the placeholder content.\n- Select the content section to open Content Properties in the Content tab.\n- Select Add New Icon.\n- You'll see a default image (the star in the gray circle). Select Change Image to customize the icon.\n- Toggle More Options to open extended options.\n- Image URLAdd a custom image URL for any image you're not uploading.\n- Alternate textAdd alternate text that describes your icon.\n- Icon textThe text that appears next to your icon. If you're using a custom icon set as bullet points, add your text in the textbox. Control where your text appears with the Text position dropdown.\n- To add more than one icon to the same block, select Add New Icon.\n- Save your design.\nMenu\nAdd a menu element to your messaging.- Create a new template or open an existing one.\n- Drag a menu block into the template.\n- Select the menu block in your template to open the Content Properties tab.\n- Add and configure menu items; set the appearance properties for the menu; set options for the whole block; and choose whether or not this is a mobile menu from the Content Properties tab.\n- Save your work. Preview and test your template to make sure your menu works as expected in a variety of environments."

        "content": "Email Composer Best Practices\nImages\nMake certain that your message can still be read and understood if a user has images turned off in their email client. To ensure readability and create an accessible message, use alt text for your images.\nHero Images\nWhen using a hero image, the image should be 500px - 700px in width. Email Composer should resize the image automatically for mobile.\nRow Background Images\nTo create a row with a background image:\n- Begin by creating a new template or selecting an existing template from the Templates List Page.\n- Select the first row once your template loads. This will open the Row Properties in the Row tab.\n- Scroll down to the Row background image section and turn the feature on.\n- Select Change Image to open your image folder. Find the image you wish to use and select Insert.\n- If you wish your image to stretch across the entire background, select the Full width option.\n- Not every email client supports background images. Go to Row background color and select a color that works with your design if you send to users who use the following email clients:\n- Outlook desktop on Windows.\nBackground images work on Outlook 2011 & Outlook 2016 on OS X, and on outlook.com\n- Lotus Notes 7\n- free.fr email client\n- T-Online.de email client\n- Xfinity / Comcast email client\n- To see the text over the row background, go to Content background color and set it to transparent.\n- Select a Content component and drag it to the row content area.\n- Add content to the component. Your content should appear overlaid on the background. For example,\nWhen you add more components, they will have a transparent background.\nMessage Body Images\nTo avoid a small space between the middle and last images in a row of three, set the justification to centered for all the images.\nDesign\nGeneral Notes\n- Button text should be under roughly 5 words/25 characters so the text won't wrap in mobile.\n- Consider creating mobile-specific buttons. You can hide specific components or rows so you can tailor your content to the environment.\n- If you use the same button or buttons for each message, create a Saved Row with your formatted buttons.\n- If you want to use a button that takes up a specific amount of space in a column, turn off auto-width. You can then select the column width percentage for your button.\n- For buttons that stack automatically in mobile, make sure Do not stack on mobile is turned off. When turned on, the slider button will appear blue.\nCreate a Transparent Button\nUse a button's Background color and Border options to create a button that uses the Row background image as its fill.\n- Follow the instructions to set a [Row background image].\n- Add a Button component to your active row.\n- Select the button to open the Content Properties tab.\n- Set the Background color to transparent.\n- Set your text color to one that contrasts with your chosen background. By default, it's set to #ffffff.\n- Scroll down to the Border section and select More options.\n- Set the type of line you wish to use, the color, and the line width for the top, right, bottom, and left borders of your button.\n- Once you set those properties, your button should appear with a transparent background and visible border.\nEmail-safe Fonts\nThere are some limitations in ensuring consistent rendering of fonts across platforms. When creating HTML emails, choose a small list of fonts that are known to work across all platforms. A reliable selection of fonts resembles the following:\n- sans-serif: Helvetica, Arial, Verdana, Trebuchet MS\n- serif: Georgia, Times New Roman, Courier\nSans-Serif Web Safe Fonts\nThese are considered safest options for sans serif fonts. If you include these in your font selections, most people will see the design as you intend.\n- Arial\n- Arial Black\n- Tahoma\n- Trebuchet MS\n- Verdana\nThe following are widely supported fonts, but it's good practice to include a more common one as a backup in your font selection:\n- Century Gothic\n- Geneva\n- Lucida\n- Lucida Sans\n- Lucida Grande\nSerif Web Safe Fonts\nThese are the safest options for serif fonts.\n- Courier\n- Courier New\n- Georgia\n- Times\n- Times New Roman\nThe following are widely supported fonts, but it's good practice to include a more common one as a backup in your font selection.\n- MS Serif\n- New York\n- Palatino\n- Palatino Linotype\nMonospace Fonts\nThere are fewer monospace fonts with wide, cross-platform support, and these are the safest choices:\nThese fonts are somewhat widely supported:\nWidely Supported Cross-Platform Fonts\nThe following fonts are widely supported across platforms.\nHelvetica, Arial, Arial Black, Comic Sans, Courier New, Georgia, Impact, Charcoal, Lucida Console, Lucida Sans Unicode, Lucida Grande, Palatino Linotype, Book Antiqua, Palatino, Tahoma, Geneva, Times, Times New Roman, Trebuchet MS, Verdana, Monaco."

Insert your annotation information in the code.\nCopyNote: You can find the code snippet and troubleshooting tips here: https://developers.google.com/gmail/promotab/troubleshooting\n<div itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/Organization\">\n<meta itemprop=\"logo\" content=\"https://www.gstatic.com/images/branding/product/1x/googleg_48dp.png\" /></div>\n<div itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/DiscountOffer\">\n<meta itemprop=\"description\" content=\"20% off\" />\n<meta itemprop=\"discountCode\" content=\"PROMO\" />\n<meta itemprop=\"availabilityStarts\" content=\"2018-01-01T08:00:00-07:00\" />\n<meta itemprop=\"availabilityEnds\" content=\"2018-04-30T23:59:59-07:00\" />\n</div><div itemscope itemtype=\"http://schema.org/PromotionCard\">\n<meta itemprop=\"image\" content=\"https://www.google.com/gmail-for-marketers/promo-tab/markup-tool/sample.png\" /></div> - Copy and paste your Annotations code into your HTML block.

        "content": "Implement Liveintent Tags\nLiveIntent tags require unique variables (macros) to function properly. The values are called into LiveIntent tags at the time the email is sent.\nThe variables include:\n- An email\n- A unique placement id\n- A list id (optional, but used for reporting)\nTo set these up, you'll need to swap these LiveIntent values with template variables using Zephyr.\n| LiveIntent Tag | Description | Template Variable |\n|---|---|---|\n| Maps to an email or an MD5 hash of an email in the platform. Variable e={Email} m={MD5 hash} (recommended)Note: As a privacy best practice, hash email addresses. | Email {email}MD5 hash of an email {md5(email)} | |\n| Placement ID | This must be a unique number specific to the individual user and the campaign. To get this kind of value, we recommend combining the \"emailnum\" variable with a date value or the blast id.Emailnum represents the order of the message in the total send, i.e. 20 would be the 20th message sent in the campaign Variable p={Placement ID} | Date and emailnum {date('MMddyyyy')+emailnum}Blast ID and emailnum {blast.id+emailnum} |\n| List ID optional, but needed for reporting | There isn't a template variable called list_id. You can use other values to identify the campaign in their reporting. We recommend:\n|\nNumerical campaign ID {blast.id}Campaign list name {blast.list}Campaign Name {blast.name} |\n| Key/Value Pairs | Set custom key/value pairs for demographic data or list segments. Variable {key}={variable} | Reference template or profile custom fields as needed. |\nUsing LiveIntent Values in Templates\nIn Email Composer, add an HTML block and add LiveIntent tags to your template there. Templates using Liveintent tags must be dynamic templates.\nTo add an HTML block to your template in Email Composer:\n- Decide on your template formatting. If you're using the available row structures, drag them into place on your template.\n- Drag an HTML block from the Content Pane to your desired location in your template.\n- Click the HTML block. The Content Properties pane opens for your HTML block.\n- Add your LiveIntent tags in the HTML composer in the Content Properties pane.\n- Finish editing your template."
